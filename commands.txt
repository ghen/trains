# Commands format:
#
#   <name> <path> [<limit>]
#
# Where:
#
#   name    - Name of the command (case insensitive).
#
#             Currently supported commands:
#
#               'dist'    - Calculates shortest distance
#               'routes'  - Calculates number of possible routes
#               'stops'   - Calculates minimal number of stops
#               'help'    - Outputs list of supported commands
#               'exit'    - Terminates further processing
#
#   path    - Graph path to travel/calculate.
#
#             Route is described as following:
#               'A-B'     - Direct travel between A and B
#               'A..B'    - Any possible route between A and B
#
#   limit   - (optional) Limits to apply during search/calculation.
#
#             Limits can apply to 'dist' or 'stops', and are described
#             in form of boolean condition (C# language syntax).
#             For example: 'stops == 5', or 'dist <= 20'.
#
# Notes:
#           - Empty lines are ignored
#           - Comments start with '#' character
#
# Examples:
#
